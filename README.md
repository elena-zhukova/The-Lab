# The-Lab

The project simulates lab environment and the procedure of identifying the blood type of the person. The user will take the blood sample using the pipette and pour it into the well plate. Then the user will pour the serums using other pipettes to identify presence or absence of antigens and compare the results to the cheat sheet provided as a part of the lab environment. The final goal is to determine the blood type.
